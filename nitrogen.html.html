   Nitrogen is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that makes up about 78% of Earth's atmosphere. Nitrogen is essential for life, being a key component of proteins and nucliec acids in all living oraganisms. While abundant in the atmosphere, it is 
   often in a form that is unusable by most plants and animals.

     <p>
    Nitrogen was discovered by Daniel Rutherford in 1772. He isolated it by removing oxygen and carbon dioxide from air, finding that the remaining das wouldn't support combustion or life. The name "nitrogen" comes from the Greek words "nitron"
    and "genes", meaning "nitre-forming", reflecting its presence in saltpeter(potassium nitrate).
