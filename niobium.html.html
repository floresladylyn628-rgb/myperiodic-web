    Niobium is a chemical element, symbolized as Nb, and is a transition metal. It's a soft, gray metal that's highly ductile and has a high melting point. Niobium is used in various applications, including aerospace (for rocket components and high-strength alloys), superconductors, and specialized steel alloys. Its unique properties make it useful for high-performance applications, particularly in extreme environments. 
    Niobium is also biocompatible and corrosion-resistant, making it suitable for medical implants and other uses.
   </p>
   <p>
    Niobium was discovered in 1801 by English chemist Charles Hatchett in the mineral columbite. Initially called "columbium," the element was later renamed niobium, derived from Niobe, a figure in Greek mythology. For many years, niobium and tantalum were thought to be the same element, but they were distinguished as separate elements in the 19th century. Niobium's unique properties have led to its use in various 
    high-performance applications, including aerospace, superconductors, and specialized alloys.
