 Neon is a noble gas with the atomic number 10 and symbol Ne. It's colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas that's unreactive
 and stable due to its full outer energy level. It is unreactive and stable due to its full outer energy level.

  Neon was discovered in 1898 by Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers. They discovered
  neon while experimenting with liquefied air and isolating other noble gases, such as krypton and xenon. The name "neon"
  comes from the Greek word "neos", meaning "new". Ramsay's discovery of neon led to the development of neon signs, which 
  were first introduced in the early 20th century and have since become a popular form of advertising and art.
