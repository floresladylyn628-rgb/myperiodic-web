    Potassium is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal with the atomic number 19 and symbol K. It's highly reactive and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including nerve function and 
    muscle contraction. Potassium is also used in industrial applications, such as fertilizers and manufacturing
   </p>
   <p>
    Potassium was first isolated by Sir Humphry Davy in 1807 through the electrolysis of caustic potash (KOH).
     Davy named the element "potassium" from the word "potash," which refers to the substance from which it was derived. 
     Potassium was one of the first elements to be isolated through electrolysis, and its discovery helped to establish 
     the field of electrochemistry. The element's name comes from 
    its source in plant ashes, and it has since been found to be an essential element for plant and animal life.
