Oganesson is a synthetic, transuranium element. While classified as a noble gas, theoritical predictions suggest
that relativistic effects make it exhibit metalloid characteristics, potentially existing as a solid rather than a gas
at room temperature. Only a few unstable atoms have been created, decaying via alpha emission in less than a 
millisecond, and its physical and chemical properties remain largely unknown.
   </p>
   <p>
Oganesson was discovered by a Joint Russian-American team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research 
in Dubna, Russia, in 2002, with further experiments confirming its existence by 2005 and 2006. The element is 
named to honor Yuri Oganessian, a leading Russian physicist in the discovery of superheavy eleemnts, and was 
officially named in 2016 by the IUPAC and IUPAP.

            <hr>

           Oganesson has no practical applications or commercial use at present, as only a few super-short-lived 
           atoms have been synthesized. Its only use is in scientific research to better understand superheavy 
           elements, test theories in nuclear physics, and explore the properties of this newly created element.
