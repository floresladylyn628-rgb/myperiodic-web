Phosphorus is a highly reactive, non-metallic element with atomic number 15. It exists in all several allotropic forms, including
white, red, and black phosphorus, each with distinct properties. White phosphorus is highly toxic and reactive, while red 
phosphorus is more stable.
   </p>
   <p>
  Phosphorus was discovered in 1669 by German alchemist Henning Brand, who isolated it from urine while searching for the 
  Philosopher's Stone. Brand's method involved boiling urine and collecting the residue, which glowed in the dark due to the 
  presence of phosphorus. Initially, phosphorus was known for its eerie glow and was called "cold fire" or "phosphor", derived
  from the Greek words "phos" (light) and "phoros" (bearing).
